        <h1>[AUTO]STITCHING PHOTO MOSAICS</h1>
        <h3>Quang Nguyen, SID: 3036566521</h3>

        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>This project aims to build intuitions behind the creation of a large composite image by stitching together photographs. More specifically, in the first part of the project, I </p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Shot and digitized pictures.</li>
            <li>Recovered homographies for projective warping.</li>
            <li>Warped images.</li>
            <li>Blended images into a mosaic by resampling and compositing them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the second part, I automated the correspondence-determination process in Part 1 so that I can automatically stitch images together to create panoramas. That is, I:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Detected evenly spread-out Harris corners/interest points in an image with adaptive non-maximal suppression.</li>
            <li>Extracted feature descriptors from the corners and matched the descriptors between two images.</li>
            <li>Computed the homography matrix between two images with RANSAC</li>
            <li>Blended images into a mosaic by resampling and compositing them using the resulting homography.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Recover Homographies</h4>
        <p>From lecture, we define an projective transformation using a homography matrix as follow: 
            \[H\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p'}\]
            \[\begin{bmatrix}
            a & b & c\\
            d & e & f\\
            g & h & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
            x \\ y \\ 1
            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            x' \\ y' \\ 1
            \end{bmatrix}\]</p>
        <p>Exapnding this matrix multiplication out, we get the following system of equations: 
            \[
            \begin{cases}
                ax + by + c = x' \\
                dx + ey + f = y' \\
                gx + hy + 1 = 1
            \end{cases} \Rightarrow 
            \begin{cases}
                ax + by + c - gxx' - hyx' = x' \\
                dx + ey + f - gxy' - hyy' = y' 
            \end{cases}
            \]
        </p>
        <p> Rewriting the system of equations as matrix multiplication, we obtain
            \[\begin{bmatrix}
            x & y & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -xx' & -yx'\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x & y & 1 & -xy' & -yy'
            \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
            a \\ b \\ c \\ d \\ e \\ f \\ g \\ h
            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            x' \\ y'
            \end{bmatrix}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Since each point gives up two equations and we need at least 4 equations to solve for \(H\), we need at least 4 correspondence points and the matrix multiplication becomes
            \[\begin{bmatrix}
            x_1 & y_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1x_1' & -y_1x_1' \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 & -x_1y_1' & -y_1y_1' \\
            x_2 & y_2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_2x_2' & -y_2x_2' \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x_2 & y_2 & 1 & -x_2y_2' & -y_2y_2' \\
            x_3 & y_3 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_3x_3' & -y_3x_3' \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x_3 & y_3 & 1 & -x_3y_3' & -y_3y_3' \\
            x_4 & y_4 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_4x_4' & -y_4x_4' \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & x_4 & y_4 & 1 & -x_4y_4' & -y_4y_4' \\
            \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
            a \\ b \\ c \\ d \\ e \\ f \\ g \\ h
            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
            x_1' \\ y_1' \\ x_2' \\ y_2' \\ x_3' \\ y_3' \\ x_4' \\ y_4'
            \end{bmatrix}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Since I used more than 4 correspondence points (on averaged, I had about 14 correspondence points for each pair of images), the system of equation will be overconstrained. As a result, I used <code>np.linalg.lstsq</code> to solve for least squares solution. I then just reorganized the entries from the least squares vector to obtain an approximate \(H\).</p>
        
        <h4>3. Warp the Images</h4>
        <p>Given an image to be warped <code>im</code> and a homography matrix \(H\), I warp the image as follow:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Compute the bounding box in the resulting image by applying the homography matrix onto the four corners to <code>im</code>. This gives the polygon where the projected <code>im</code> will be in the resulting warped image.</li>
            <li>Compute the corresponding pixels in the original <code>im</code> for each pixel in the resulting image by applying the inverse of the homography matrix to each pixel of the resulting image (inverse warping guarantees the smoothness in the resulting image).</li>
            <li>Interpolate the pixels values using <code>scipy.interpolate.griddata</code> to obtain the final warped resulting image.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>4. Image Rectification</h4>
        <p>To rectify an image, I completed the following steps:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Define 4 correspondence points using a known rectangular object in the image</li>
            <li>Determine the height-to-width ratio of the object and use that to define the size of the ground plane rectification</li>
            <li>Compute the homography matrix and use that with <code>warpImage</code> from the previous part to recover the original data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some results of me applying rectification on different rectangular objects/surfaces:</p>

                <p>Rectification of a book</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h4>5. Blend the images into a mosaic</h4>
        <p>To blend two images together, I completed the following procedure:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Computed the homography matrix between the two images and warp one image using the other as a reference.</li>
            <li>Depending on the placement of the warped image (left, right, above, or below) of the reference image, computed the shape of the final mosaic.</li>
            <li>Aligned the images onto the mosaic appropriately using the offsets output from the warping.</li>
            <li>Computed a distance metric using <code>scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt</code> for each image and created a mask where a pixel value is 1 if the distance metric for that pixel is greater for the warped image and 0 otherwise.</li>
            <li>Blended the two images together using a two-level Laplacian pyramid (similar to Project 2).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To blend three images together where the center image is chosen to be the reference image, I completed the following procedure:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Computed the shape of the final mosaic using the offsets output from warping the left and right images into the center image.</li>
            <li>Blended the left and the center images together using the aforementioned process to create a temporary mosaic.</li>
            <li>Blended this temporary mosaic and the right image together using the aforementioned process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice that the color a little off in some of the blended mosaics because the lighting conditions of the input images weren't consistent (also potentially because iPhone camera automatically adjusts the focus and exposure of the photos).</p>
        <p>Here are the results of blending the images into a mosaic where for each group of images, the first row contains the input images and the second row displays the resulting warped and blended image:</p>

        <h2>PART B: FEATURE MATCHING FOR AUTOSTITCHING</h2>
        <h4>1. Harris Corner Detection</h4>
        <p>To identify all the corners/interest points of an image, I used the <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa24/hw/proj4/harris.py">functions</a> provided by course staff, which outputs a list of coordinates with higher corner strength than their immediate neighbors. Notice that without further filtering, there are too many possible candidates for Harris corners, which is too computationally inefficient to work with. Here are the Harris corners on two example images:</p>

                <img src="out/steps/harris_sodas.jpg" alt="harris corners of images of soda hall">
                <p>Images of Soda Hall with labeled Harris Corners</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>2. Adaptive Non-Maximal Suprression</h4>
        <p>I then impletemed Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression on the list of Harris corners, which restricted the maximum number of interest points and ensured that the resulting points are spatially well distributed over the input image. Here are the remaining keypoints after ANMS: </p>

                <p>Images of Soda Hall with labeled Harris Corners after ANMS</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Feature Descriptor Extraction</h4>
        <p>To extract features from each Harris corner after ANMS, I extracted axis-aligned 40x40 patches and downsampled them with <code>anti_aliasing=True</code> to obtain 8x8 feature patches and avoid aliasing. I then normalized the descriptors to ensure that their mean is 0 and their variance is 1. Here are some examples of the feature descriptors of an image of Soda Hall:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <div class="image-single">
                <img src="out/steps/features_sodas.jpg" alt="some feature descriptors of an image of soda hall">
                <p>Examples of feature descriptors of an image of Soda Hall</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>4. Feature Matching</h4>
        <p>To match the features, I first flattened them from 8x8 patches to 64-dimensional vectors. I computed the Euclidean distance between each vector in the first descriptor and all vectors in the second descriptor to obtain a list of <code>distances</code>. I then sorted this list in ascending order to retrieve the distance of the 1-NN and 2-NN and used Lowe's technique to determine matches: If the ratio of 1-NN over 2-NN is below the threshold <code>threshold</code>, then the 1-NN is considered to be a match. Here are the matched features between two images of Soda Hall:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <div class="image-single">
                <img src="out/steps/fmatch_lines_sodas.jpg" alt="feature matches with threshold 0.5">
                <p>Feature matches with threshold \(t=0.5\)</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>5. RANSAC</h4>
        <p>Even after using Lowe's technique to reduce the number of outliers, there remains inaccurate pair of correspondence points, mainly due to the fact that Euclidean distance, or least-squares, is still vulnerable to outliers. As a result, I implemented RANSAC as followed:</p>
        <ul class="actions-list">
            <li>Initialize an empty list that will contain the best correspondence points</li>
            <li>Randomly sample 4 pairs of points and compute the homography matrix between the two set of points using the function <code>computeH</code> from part A</li>
            <li>Transform all the points of one image to the other using the homography matrix. Compute the Euclidean distance between the transformed points and the ground truth points. If the distance between a pair is less than <code>epsilon</code>, add that pair of points to the list of inliers. If the list of inliers for this homography has greater size than the current list of best correspondence points, set this to be the list of best correspondence points. </li>
            <li>Repeat this process <code>num_times</code> times and output the resulting list of best correspondence points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the result of running RANSAC on the set of matched features from Lowe's technique:</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <div class="image-single">
                <img src="out/steps/ransac_lines_sodas.jpg" alt="feature matches with threshold 0.5 after ransac">
                <p>Feature matches with threshold \(t=0.5\) after RANSAC</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>We notice that both automatically and manually mosaics yield pretty similar results, illustrating the robustness of the involved algorithms such as Harris corners, ANMS, or RANSAC.</p>
        <h4>7. What have I learned?</h4>
        <p>The coolest things I have learned from this project are rectification and automatic stitching through feature descriptors extraction and matching. After project 3 and course lectures, I was already intrigued by the extended application of linear algebra in warping one shape into another. While working on this project, I was particularly surprised and amazed by how much we could stretch the image with the homography matrix to accurately rectify a rectangular surface without encountering aliasing problems even when the surface is extremely skewed. </p>
        <p>Similarly, from project 3 to project 4A, the typical procedure of determining the transformation matrix given two images includes manually defining correspondence points through a mouse-clicking interface, which involves a decent amount of tedious work, and recovering the transformation matrix using the <code>numpy</code> library. This procedure is effectively and sufficiently automated in project 4B, where I implemented interest point detection with Harris corners and ANMS, feature descriptor extraction with Gaussian blurring, and robust feature matching with Lowe's technique and RANSAC. Thanks to this much needed automation, I was able explore mosaicing images with fewer corners (I didn't include results for these images in this writeup).</p>
